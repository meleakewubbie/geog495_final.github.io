# Meleake's NBA Stadiums Map

[Application](https://github.com/meleakewubbie/geog495_final.github.io/blob/master/index.html) 

My goal is to display where NBA stadiums are located. Information about teams such as confrence, division, and city are also shown. There are a 30 teams in the NBA. The teams are divided into the western confrence and the eastern confrence. After, they are further divided into divisons. Each divison has 5 teams. I used blue markers for eastern confrence teams and red markers for western confrence teams. I also changed the shade of blue and red to show different divisions. The side panel lists all the NBA arenas and cities. They are grouped by the division the team plays in.
