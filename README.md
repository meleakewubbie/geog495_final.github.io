## Description

My goal is to display where NBA stadiums are located. Information about teams such as confrence, division, and city are also shown. There are a 30 teams in the NBA. The teams are divided into the western confrence and the eastern confrence. After, they are further divided into divisons. Each divison has 5 teams. I used blue markers for eastern confrence teams and red markers for western confrence teams. I also changed the shade of blue and red to show different divisions. The side panel lists all the NBA arenas and cities. They are grouped by the division the team plays in. The user can zoom in and out to view any team. This map can be useful to anyone who wants to know about teams in the NBA. It allows the user to vizualize teams based on their location. Looking at the map, it's clear that teams are in a certain division for traveling reasons. All the shaded blue marker teams are close by and the same for the shaded red marker teams. Each division has teams that are nearby each other. Since divisional teams play each other the most, it makes sense to group them together.
